##Chatroom
Chatroom Using ```nodejs/express/mongodb/socket.io```
MongoDB helps it to preserve the data. 
Since users have no passwords, it makes no sense to check some certain nickname's history record. Whenever people open the page, it will print out the latest ten messages.
Using the same nickname is forbidden.
It also has a real-time user list showed on the right side of the page.
